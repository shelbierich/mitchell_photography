## Description
```
I have created this website to show the amazing photography work of a friend. 

```



## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. class name .boxed
this class creates a rounded, colored border around the name of the copany while also centering the name itself.

2. class name .topnav
this class creates a grey-like background color for my navigation bar.

3. class name .topnav a:hover
this class changes the color around the text on the nav bar when you hover over them while also changing the color of the text.

4. class name .form
this class creates a padding and changes the color of the text in the submit form on the nav bar.




## Custom JavaScript Functions

The javascript functions I created are:

1. function name valdateform
this function sends an alert message to fill out your name and email when the submit button is clicked without completing the form.
