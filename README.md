## Description
```
I have created a simple website to showcase the amazing photography work of a family friend. This site allows you to view some of the photos she has taken and you even have the ability to enlarge those photos with a simple click so you can take a closer look. I have placed an area to submit your name and email that will eventually allow you to actually submit your information so that she can contact you for any questions you may have.

## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. class name .boxed
this class creates a rounded, colored border around the name of the copany while also centering the name itself.

2. class name .topnav
this class creates a grey-like background color for my navigation bar.

3. class name .topnav a:hover
this class changes the color around the text on the nav bar when you hover over them while also changing the color of the text.

4. class name .form
this class creates a padding and changes the color of the text in the submit form on the nav bar.




## Custom JavaScript Functions

The javascript functions I created are:

1. function name valdateform
This function sends an alert message to the user to fill out his/her name and email when the submit button is clicked without completing the form. When the information is completed and the submit button is clicked it will send you to a webpage with an error for the time being.
